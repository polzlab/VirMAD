## Comparative Genomics
The folder Comparative_Genomics contains julia and bash scripts to carry out a comparative analysis on a group of host and viral genomes, while utilizing experimental cross-infection matrix data. The scripts are tailored for the specific case of the Nahant cross infection matrix, but can be trivially adjusted to any other genome resolved cross-infectio matrix. For questions and clarifications about the comparative genomics analysis please email Shaul Pollak at shaul.pollak.pasternak@univie.ac.at
